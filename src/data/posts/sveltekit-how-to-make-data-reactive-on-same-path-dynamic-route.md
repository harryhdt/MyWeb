When I used SvelteKit default routing, I found cases where the data didn't change when opening a route of the same level, for example <ins>"/pages/one"</ins> to be <ins>"/pages /two"</ins>, which This should do changing when navigated to pages **"two"**, Expected get **"two"** data, but actually the data doesn't change, i.e. it's always **"one"** data.

The solution was simple, turns out I just changed the variable declaration for the initial data

`let data = reactive_value`

become

`$: data = reactive_value`

So by default the variable **"data"** will respond to changes that occur from its value.

This solution worked for me, but I don't think it's necessarily the answer for your case.Â
